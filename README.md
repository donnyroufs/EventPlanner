A work in progress EventPlanner which has a unique use-case and isn't your generic agenda. I'm kidding, I'm talking bullshit. This is just a dummy project to get myself into C# with no intentions for real use. Feel free to review my code to tell me what I could have done differently, on a technical C# level!



## Todos
- [x] Change private method convention to CamelCase

- [x] Add virtual folders (src/tests)

- [x] Integration Tests
  - Refactor get occasions by given range since there's no range!

- [ ] Handling null values (e.g. in repo)

- [ ] Add filters (error handling, includes integration tests)

- [ ] Create aggregate, do mutations in memory and store events to then persist. (can be done without events cus of ef core)

- [ ]  Add real email service

- [ ]  Replace in memory with psql driver

- [ ]  Setup configuration (for example system email)

- [ ]  Look into deployment

- [ ]  Add authentication

- [ ]  Make sure code is consistent, get into "best practices" for C#.
