A work in progress dummy EventPlanner which has a unique use-case and isn't your generic agenda. I'm kidding, I'm talking bullshit. This is just a dummy project to get myself into C# with no intentions for real use. Feel free to review my code to tell me what I could have done differently, on a technical C# level!
